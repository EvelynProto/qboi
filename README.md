# QualityBoi
A very Quality Discord Bot

## Requirements  
To run this you need to have Python 3.7 or later along with the following packages:
- discord.py
- youtube_dl
- ffmpeg (in your PATH too)

## Setup
Clone the repo 
Do "pip install discord.py youtube_dl" in cmd (probably a good idea to have administrator perms too)
Install ffmpeg into a folder and add the folder with "ffmpeg.exe" in it into your PATH environmental variable - Restart your PC.
Please, please, please, please make sure you have a folder called tmp with it or all music commands will not work.
Run main.py (I think thats everything?)
