A very Quality Discord Bot

## Requirements  
To run this you need to have Python 3.7 or later along with the following packages:
- discord.py
- youtube_dl
- ffmpeg (in your PATH too)
- At least 11GB of storage (Keeps upto 10GB of previously played music (Yes that is how i've done the music command (Yes it does download music then play it)))

## Setup
- Clone the repo
- Do "pip install discord.py youtube_dl" in cmd (probably a good idea to have administrator perms too)
- Install ffmpeg into a folder and add the folder with "ffmpeg.exe" in it into your PATH environmental variable - Restart your PC.
- Please, please, please, please make sure you have a folder called tmp with it or all music commands will not work.
- Run main.py (I think thats everything?)
